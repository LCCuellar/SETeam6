Test

Changes to be made:
	1. need to add add methods to add workshops, units, and groups to their respective sets
	2. define every instance of configurations. (what it contains)
	3. need to add the equal method to ensure that the set comparisons work
	4. hash function needs to be added as well
	5. there should only be a workhop set that holds both the associated groups and units
	6. start vm methods need to be added to the workshop unit class
	7. methods for stopping, pausing all instances (units, vms,)
	8. units and groups wanna be subclasses (need to google how to do inheritance in python)
	9. add crud for group and unit (create, update, delete, remove)
	10. 
	

	
Test Cases:
	1. addWorkshopUnit - decision table test:
		@requires configurations has fields "unitname", "vms", "connectionString"
		@ensures /result == true if workshopUnit is not in unitList || /result == false if workshopUnit is in unitList
		
		addWorkshopUnit(self, configurations){...}
		
		cases:
			1. unitName
			2. vm list
			3. connection string
			4. In unitList
			
		actions:
			1. true
			2. false
